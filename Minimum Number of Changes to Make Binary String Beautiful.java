/*
You are given a 0-indexed binary string s having an even length.

A string is beautiful if it's possible to partition it into one or more substrings such that:

Each substring has an even length.
Each substring contains only 1's or only 0's.
You can change any character in s to 0 or 1.

Return the minimum number of changes required to make the string s beautiful.
