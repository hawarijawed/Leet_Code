/*
The XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements, or 0 if the array is empty.

For example, the XOR total of the array [2,5,6] is 2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1.
Given an array nums, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of nums. 

Note: Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.

An array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.
